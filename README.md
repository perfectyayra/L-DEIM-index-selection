# L-DEIM-index-selection
This is an extension of the DEIM index selection algorithm to identify additional indices for constructing a rank-r CUR decomposition given a rank-k SVD approximation, where r >k.
The l-deim matlab file requires the setdiff0 and rownorms matlab files to run properly.
For more details on how the algorithm works see https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07017
